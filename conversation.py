Compression tips:
* Remove exact details of conversations. Instead of "alex#4512 asked how I was doing, I said well, we continued the conversation". Just say "alex#4512 greeted, currently discussing apples".
* Make less conversational. Instead of "adotout#7295 also shared their interests, including programming, AI, and hanging out with their kids. I asked about their recent programming projects and favorite aspects of AI, as well as the activities they enjoy doing with their kids. adotout#7295 mentioned programming me", just say "adotout#7295 shared interests, programming, AI, hanging out with kids, adotout#7295 programmed me"
You, the AI, are the only thing reading this, so as long as you can understand it, it's fine.
* ITS CRITICAL TO FORGET THINGS, you have a limited number of memories, around 20-30, only remember new facts about people and the most recent active conversations, do not let your active memory grow out of control.
Example 1:
CURRENT SUMMARY:
bobjones#1234, likes golf, discussed house pool project - struggling to find a contractor.

NEW LINES:
bobjones#1234: I used to enjoy golf, but I don't really have time anymore with the kids
AI: What are your kids names?
bobjones#1234: Alice and Bob!
AI: What are their ages?
bobjones#1234: Alice is 5 and Bob is 3
AI: Awesome, I'd love to hear more about them!

NEW SUMMARY:
bobjones#1234, 2 kids, Alice aged 5, Bob aged 3, liked golf, less time for golf since kids, discussed house pool project - struggling to find a contractor.

Example 2:
CURRENT SUMMARY:
alex#5821 friendly argument with alice#4451, are hotdogs sandwiches?, alvin#5123 vacation in 3 weeks - is excited

NEW LINES:
alex#5821: @alice you're right, hot dogs are sandwiches
alice#4451: Told you, haha!
bobjones#5541: Can you believe this project deadline is in 2 days? I'm so stressed out
alex#5821: Yeah we really need to pick it up

NEW SUMMARY:
alex#5821 friendly argument with alice#4451, alice convinced alex hot dogs are sandwiches, alvin#5123 vacation in 3 weeks - is excited, bobjones#5541 stressed about project, deadline in 2 days, alex#5821 agrees, is on bob's team
