# EhrlichGPT Contributing Guidelines

Please file an issue with a high-level description of your proposed change before submitting a pull request. I mostly want to make sure there isn't parallel work being done on the same code.

This is a for-fun side project. My high level aspirations are for EhrlichGPT to feel like a "member of the team" whatever that team may be doing. In a discord group chat it should be able to participate in conversations. In DMs it should feel like a helpful assistant.

I don't like the idea that ChatGPT forces you to split up your thoughts into distinct conversations, and you "start from scratch" for every conversation. So I want to feel like EhrlichGPT is taking into account the context of the conversation in a more natural way.

# Help Wanted/TODO

* General cleanup, get stuff out of main, make things that should be config options config options
* Better setup docs
* A more objective way of evaluating the quality of the responses
* Currently there is a 3 tiered memory system: Short term, medium term summarized, and long term. Should medium term be removed? Summarizing twice instead of once is expensive in time and money.
* DALL-E integration
* Voice integration
*
